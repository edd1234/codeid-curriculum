# Summer Master Plan
We have around ***12 weeks*** of summer time to work on curriculum development! It's a lot shorter than it appears. But I'm both optimistic and ambitious on what we can achieve this summer. :)

Our goal for this summer is to create and code _**2-3 projects**_ that we can release in the fall.
