# Summer Master Plan
We have around ***12 weeks*** of summer time to work on curriculum development! It's a lot shorter than it appears. But I'm both optimistic and ambitious on what we can achieve this summer. :)

Our goal for this summer is to create and code _**2-3 projects**_ that we can release in the fall. 

Tentative Primary Deadlines:
* Project 1: July 21
* Project 2: August 21
* Project 3: September 21

Alternative Deadlines:
* Project 1: August 5
* Project 2: September 21

NOTE: These two schedules would depend on the scope of the projects that we choose (e.g. two large projects or three smaller projects). In the event that we're behind in development, the alternative schedule is designed to provide more flexibility.


Here is the general outline of what we would do during each project development:
|Week|Action 1|Action 2|
|----|--------|--------|
|1|organizing the curriculum structure|
|2|coding|testing|
