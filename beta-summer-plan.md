# Summer Master Plan
We have around ***12 weeks*** of summer time to work on curriculum development! It's a lot shorter than it appears. But I'm both optimistic and ambitious on what we can achieve this summer. :)

Our goal for this summer is to create and code _**2-3 projects**_ that we can release in the fall. 

### Tentative Primary Deadlines:
* Project 1: July 21
* Project 2: August 21
* Project 3: September 21

### Alternative Deadlines:
* Project 1: August 5
* Project 2: September 21


NOTE: These two schedules would depend on the scope of the projects that we choose (e.g. two large projects or three smaller projects). In the event that we're behind in development, the alternative schedule is designed to provide more flexibility.

Here is the general outline of what we would do during each project development:
|Week|Action 1|Action 2|
|----|--------|--------|
|1|brainstorming key concepts|outlining a lesson plan|
|2|coding|debugging|
|3|coding|debugging / real-world testing|
|4|revision|real-world testing|

In reality, the revision and real-world testing phase might be the most time-consuming part of each project. Also, creating a strong outline and delegating responsibilities efficiently will be crucial to our success. It is important to note that these are suggestions rather than hard deadlines.

Here are the list of potential projects:
* Geometry Art
* Tic-Tac-Toe
* Hangman Game
* Encryption Challenge (e.g. substitution cipher, Caesar cipher)
* Breakout Game

Note: The above list is subject to change.
